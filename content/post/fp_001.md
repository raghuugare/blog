## FP - 01

Here we go!

We would like to take the readers on a brief excursion to FP(Functional Programming) Land.

We would like to use Haskell as our guide--though you are free to choose any of your favourite programming languegs as your medium.

Solution of a Quadratic equation of the form: \\( ax^{2}+bx +c=0 \\)

\\[ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} \\]

## Over to some code

Here's a sample code snippet in C:

``` python

```

Above is a simple C-program with a function to compute the `factorial` of a positive integer _defined & exercised_.

## A Java program...

Below is a Java program to be saved in a file named `Greeter.java`

``` java
public class Greeter {

    public String greet(String target) {
        return "Hello " + target + "! :)";
    }

    public void static main(String[] args) {
        Greeter greeter = new Greeter();
        String greeting = greeter.greet("World");
        System.out.println(greeting);
    }

}

```

## A Lisp program/function...

Now, we show a simple LISP function to print the same. The function used is `format`.

``` common-lisp
(format t "Hello World ! :) ~%")
;; ~% stands for our ubiquitous "\n" (newline) character...
```

## A Table

   Name | Age
--------|------
    Bob | 27
  Alice | 23

## And now, how about some Haskell ?

Here's a tiny gem for finding the factorial of an integer `n` :

``` haskell

factorial :: Int -> Int
factorial n
    | n <= 0    = 1
    | otherwise = n * factorial (n-1)

```

``` tex

``Computers are useless--they can only give you answers.'' -- Pablo Picasso

Consider the following equation:

$ x + y = z $

```
